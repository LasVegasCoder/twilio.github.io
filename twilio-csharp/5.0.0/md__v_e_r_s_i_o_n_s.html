<div class="textblock"><p><code>twilio-csharp</code> uses a modified version of <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> for all changes to the helper library. It is strongly encouraged that you pin at least the major version and potentially the minor version to avoid pulling in breaking changes.</p>
<p>Semantic Versions take the form of <code>MAJOR</code>.<code>MINOR</code>.<code>PATCH</code></p>
<p>When bugs are fixed in the library in a backwards compatible way, the <code>PATCH</code> level will be incremented by one. When new features are added to the library in a backwards compatible way, the <code>PATCH</code> level will be incremented by one. <code>PATCH</code> changes should <em>not</em> break your code and are generally safe for upgrade.</p>
<p>When a new large feature set comes online or a small breaking change is introduced, the <code>MINOR</code> version will be incremented by one and the <code>PATCH</code> version reset to zero. <code>MINOR</code> changes <em>may</em> require some amount of manual code change for upgrade, guidance will be provided in the https://github.com/twilio/twilio-csharp/blob/master/UPGRADE.md "Upgrade Guide". These backwards-incompatible changes will generally be limited to a small number of function signature changes.</p>
<p>The <code>MAJOR</code> version is used to indicate the family of technology represented by the helper library. It increased from <code>4.x.x</code> to <code>5.x.x</code> when Twilio moved to auto generation of helper libraries. Breaking changes that requires extensive reworking of code (like the <code>4.x.x</code> to <code>5.x.x</code> upgrade) will cause the <code>MAJOR</code> version to be incremented by one, the <code>MINOR</code> and <code>PATCH</code> versions will be reset to zero. Twilio understands that this can be very disruptive, we will only introduce this type of breaking change when absolutely necessary. New <code>MAJOR</code> versions will be communicated in advance with <code>Release Candidates</code> and a schedule.</p>
<h2>Change Logs</h2>
<p>Twilio maintains a comprehensive https://github.com/twilio/twilio-csharp/blob/master/CHANGES.md "Changelog" for every version that is released. This will contain useful information every new version and what bugs have been fixed, features added, and functionality enhanced. After 5.1.1 Twilio will maintain an https://github.com/twilio/twilio-csharp/blob/master/UPGRADE.md "Upgrade Guide" for every change (<code>MINOR</code> or <code>MAJOR</code>) that requires changes to your code. When upgrading between two versions that have more than a <code>PATCH</code> level change, it's best practice to check the https://github.com/twilio/twilio-csharp/blob/master/UPGRADE.md "Upgrade Guide" and to make sure that all your tests and static checks pass after upgrade.</p>
<h2>Supported Versions</h2>
<p><code>twilio-csharp</code> follows an evergreen model of support. New features and functionality will only be added to the current version. The current version - 1 will continue to be supported with bugfixes and security updates, but no new features.</p>
<h2>Edge Features (Alpha Branch)</h2>
<p>Twilio frequently rolls out new features in public and private beta periods. Twilio strives to ship early and often and bake customer feedback back into our products. To support that mission, the <code>twilio-csharp</code> helper library has an <code>Edge</code> version based of the <code>alpha</code> branch. This version is identified with an <code>alpha</code> metadata tag on the version number.</p>
<p>The way the <code>Edge</code> artifact is created is by playing the <code>Edge</code> features on top of our stable artifact. The <code>Edge</code> artifact will always have the same version number as the stable artifact it was created from, but with an <code>alpha</code> suffix.</p>
<p>For example, <code>5.0.1-alpha1</code> is the <code>5.0.1</code> branch with <code>Edge</code> features included. If there is a change to one of the <code>Edge</code> features we may regenerate the <code>Edge</code> artifact and release a new <code>5.0.1-alpha2</code>, new <code>Edge</code> artifacts simply increment the number after the <code>alpha</code> suffix. All <code>Edge</code> features are considered unstable and a backwards incompatible change in an <code>Edge</code> feature will not cause any version change so you should take care when upgrading from one <code>alpha</code> version to another.</p>
<p>Once an <code>Edge</code> feature has matured it will be considered <code>Mainline</code> and included in the stable artifact, with a <code>MAJOR</code> or <code>MINOR</code> version bump.</p>
<p>To use an <code>Edge</code> artifact in your PHP project you will have to make sure that you pin the artifact with <code>alpha</code> stability in your package.json. </p>
